# LipSync.AI

Lipsync.ai is an implementation of the LIPNET model, a state-of-the-art deep learning approach for sentence-level lipreading. The original work was conducted by Yannis M. Assael, Brendan Shillingford, Shimon Whiteson, and Nando de Freitas from the University of Oxford and Google DeepMind.

## Introduction

This repository contains the code implementation for Lipsync.ai, a powerful tool for end-to-end sentence-level lipreading. The project is based on the LIPNET model, which was developed by researchers at the University of Oxford and Google DeepMind.

## Features

- End-to-End Sentence-Level Lipreading
- Implementation of the LIPNET model
- User-Friendly End-to-End Lipreading Experience

### Installation

1. Clone the LipNet repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Arnav131003/LipSync.ai
    cd LipSync.ai
    pip install requirements.txt
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

      - Keras 2.0+
      - Tensorflow 2.0+
      - PIP (for package installation)
     - Streamlit

## Usage

1. Prepare input data: Ensure video sequences contain clear lip movements.

2. Run LipSync:

    ```
    python frontend.py 
    ```

3. Analyze results: Review the generated transcript for accuracy.
